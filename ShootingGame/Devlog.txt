Idea:
A top-down shooter survival game, where the player has to fight off waves of enemies without the ability to regain health.

Mechanics:
All graphics in ASCII in the console window.
Screen centers on player, allowing maps larger than window.
Player move with WASD, shoots with left click in direction of mouse.
Enemies spawn at regular intervals from spawners and slowly increase in numbers.
Enemies are one-hit-kill. Bullets stop at killing one enemy, do not shoot through multiple.
Map has lightmap, only lit tiles and entities render.
Player has flashlight in mouse direction, if I can figure out how.
Shooting emits flash of light, light sources can be placed on map.
Player picks map from list at start of game, returned to menu after end.
Stats window at end of game, high scores.
